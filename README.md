# Loan Default Risk Analysis

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of loan default risk. The project aims to uncover key insights and patterns from the data to help financial institutions manage their loan approval processes more effectively. The analysis focuses on identifying factors that are correlated with loan defaults and provides recommendations for improving risk assessment and lending strategies.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive EDA on loan data and previous loan applications to understand the factors influencing loan default risks. By analyzing key variables, we aim to help lenders make more informed decisions, balancing the need for business growth with minimizing the risk of financial losses.

### Key Research Questions:
1. **How does income type influence loan default rates?**
2. **Do contract types affect the likelihood of default?**
3. **How does the clientâ€™s region rating correlate with payment difficulties?**

### Key Findings:
- **Income Type**: Pensioners are less likely to default compared to salaried employees, suggesting the need for tailored loan products.
- **Contract Types**: Revolving loans are more risky, while consumer loans tend to be more manageable.
- **Region Rating**: Higher region ratings are associated with slightly higher default risks.

## Summary of the Analysis
The analysis delves into the relationship between various customer attributes (e.g., income type, education, employment duration) and loan characteristics (e.g., contract type, credit amount) to understand their impact on the likelihood of loan defaults. We explore correlations between these variables and the TARGET variable, which indicates whether a client defaulted or not.

The key insights from this analysis provide valuable recommendations to help financial institutions:

- Tailor loan products based on customer income types.
- Use contract types as a risk assessment tool.
- Incorporate external credit scores as a strong predictor of loan repayment ability.

## Next Steps
Based on the analysis, we recommend that lenders:

1. Implement risk-based loan products with adjusted terms for high-risk groups.
2. Prioritize external credit scores in loan approvals.
3. Provide financial education and support for clients with lower education levels and shorter employment durations.
